A clean, responsive profile card featuring Victor Crest’s basic profile and social stats. The layout adjusts beautifully from mobile to desktop view and includes support for dark mode using CSS custom properties and JavaScript.

Created as part of the building challenges from **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)**.

## Overview

This project is a responsive and accessible profile card component. It includes dynamic theme toggling (light/dark mode) that respects user preferences and saves them using `localStorage`. The layout uses mobile-first principles with `clamp()` for fluid scaling and media queries to ensure good visuals across various screen sizes.

The project highlights semantic HTML, consistent styling using CSS variables, and minimal JavaScript used solely for theme switching and background pattern changes.

- Optimized for smooth transitions with `prefers-reduced-motion` support
